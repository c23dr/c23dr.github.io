	3/3/20:This week I worked on drawing a mockup for the podcast and beginning to code the mockup. I decided that I wanted to have the subway with a NYC skyline moving in a loop in the background so that it seems as if the train is moving. The skyline does move in a loop but I'm having a little bit of trouble because there is a box around the skyline that you can move the image with but I would rather just have the placement of the skyline listed in the code and I would like to get rid of the box.
