	2/12/20: This week I worked on my valentines day quiz and on my portfolio. For my portfolio I decided to use for loops instead of putting in individual images so that it would be a lot more efficient. I didn't run into too many problems on my valentines day quiz but some of the buttons are blue and underlined but I'm not sure what this was caused by. I am also starting to work on a recipe genrater which I am making using an array.
