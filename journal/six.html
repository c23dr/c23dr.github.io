	12/13/19: This week I took some more photos for my subway project. I ran into a couple of issues when it came to sizing the images (using right amount of pixels) but I spent some time researching it and referring back to previouse projects so I was eventually able to figure it out. I also worked on my Javascript function this week. It's pretty simple but it did teach me the basics of Javascript and I hope that Ill eventually go back and do a little more with it so that it looks a little more sophisticated. I will probablly be able to do this once I learn some more functions in Javascript and practice applying it more to some of my code sketches and other projects.
