	12/22/19: I spent most of the past weel working on my array project and cleaning up my javascript function a little bit. I definetly learned a lot about arrays which I feel I could apply to some of my past code sketches. I also got to practice how to apply sound when you click on a certain div which will help me with my subway project. Before I only knew how to apply sound as soon as you open the pag but I didnt really know how to control it or how to control what part of the recording I wanted to play.
