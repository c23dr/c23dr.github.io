10/27/19: This week I worked on starting my project for the room. I first created a mock-up on scratch, but then I accidentally deleted it, so I've started working on it in sublime text instead. It has been going pretty well so far, but I have run into a couple of issues. I wasn't able to link each of the products in my room design, but I was able to write a description for each object. I also was able to fix my website, but I have run out of arrows to link stuff on, so I now need to figure out where I am going to link my project for the room. 

11/1/19: This week i have been working on my interactive subway map. I was able to create buttons for each line and link that button to a map of the line. I have also created buttons to link to the potfolio page but sublime text won't recognise my photos so I haven't been able to display them yet. I have also tried to create a background for the first pag eiwth the buttons but sublime text isn't recognising that document either. I began to take photos and so far I have photographed the first three stations.
