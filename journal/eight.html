	1/3/20:This week I worked a little on my subway project but I also worked on coding a new portfolio. I tried using a bunch of online templates but I couldn't really find one that I liked so I decided to code my own. I looked at other portfolios online to try and find some inspiration and I inspected the pages so that I could figure out what functions they had used for each animation. I had to do a little more research on animation functions but I can't figure out how to center the animation without it going off the page. I tried to do some research on it but none of the pages or forums were very helpful. I was able to figure out how to create a button which brings you straight to someone's email which was very helpful.
