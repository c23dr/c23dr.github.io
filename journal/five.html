	12/2/19: This week I added two more stations to my subway map. I didn't run into any issues while doing this as I used the same format from the other stations. However I decided that instead of drawing a new train each time I would just rewrite the number in preview so that the drawing were consistent. I also tried adding sound which i found difficult at first because I couldn't find what type of file it is. I also worked on Fizzbuzz this week which i struggled with at first but than i went back to the javascript and html cheat sheet and I was able to find the function that I needed.
