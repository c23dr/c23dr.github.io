	1/30/20: This week I worked a lot on coding my portfolio and on the magic trick code-sketch. I had a little bit of trouble with the magic trick code sketch because i could not figure out how to make all the divs move or how to make them dissapear. At first one of them was moving and the rest weren't but than i decided to start over and now I can't get any of them to move. I'm going to do a little more research online and see where I went wrong. I finally figured out how to center the animation for the portfolio by using both background attatchment and background position.
