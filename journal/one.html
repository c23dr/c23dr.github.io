This week I worked on my design of the room and mocked up my interactive project. My mockup went really well, and I was able to sketch the Manhattan subway map. However, I probably should have enlarged the drawing since the subway lines were so close together that it ended up looking a little bit messy. The design of the room went well at first, but when I tried to link it to my personal website, it didn’t work. My personal website didn’t seem to recognize the file, so I tried to open up the design of the room as a website. However, this didn’t work either, which left me a little stuck.
