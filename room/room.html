Chairs: I chose these chairs specifically because they have are easy to put together and look conftorable. Although some of the reviews claim that they break easily they are also very inexpensive since you can buy a four pack for $141 which averages out to about $35 per chair. I think that the chair looks best in teal, but you can also buy it in aqua,black,fuchsia,etc. https://www.amazon.com/Poly-Bark-Vortex-Chair-Walnut/dp/B0791S8TCJ/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=blue%2Bplastic%2Bdining%2Bchairs%2Bx4&qid=1571879554&refinements=p_36%3A1253525011&rnid=386465011&s=home-garden&sr=1-2&th=1/b>

Lemon tree: I chose to put a lemon tree in the room because they're very colourful and easy to grow. They only need to be watered every other day for the first week, and then one or two times a week for two months. The are also very floral so the whole room will smell like lemon. Lemon trees a;so don't cost very much since you can buy one from amazon for $19.99.

Clock: I chose this clock in particular because i think it blands in well with some of the other aesthetics in the room such as the plant holders  on tge wall and the hanging chairs. It is also pretty inexpensive at only $17.99. It is also designed to be easily hangable which means that it wont take us very long to set it up.

Whiteboard desk: I chose this whiteboard desk because students could sit around it to jot down their ideas or design certain things. These types of desks are very expensive but we can use any old table to create our own whiteboard desk. The desk will take an hour at the most to make which means that it won't take up very much of our time.

Coffee maker: I chose to put a coffee maker in the room because people might be in the room for hours at a time coding, designing, or setting up their projects so they might need a caffiene boost. Although you have to use your own grounds it does prevent us from wastic plastic by using pods. It is also very inexpensive as it only costs $12.68.

Cereal dispenser: I chose to put a cereal dispenser in the room because cereal tastes great and it is much easier to use a dispenser than to pour it out of a box. Cereal is a good food because it doesn't expire very quickly and it doesn't need to be refrigerated our reheated. You can also put other snacks in this dispenser such as pretzels or goldfish.

Drawing Tablets: These drawing tablets can be used by any students who need to jot down some ideas or design anything. They each come with a pen and an erase button so that the writing board can clear as soon as your done. We can also buy a couple of them since they only cost $9.34.

Shelf for drawing tablets: These shelves can be used to store the drawing tablets, but they can also be used to store anything else that is taking up a lot of room. They are also easy to install and won't take up too much room on the wall so that their is enough room to project projects. These particular shelves cost $19.99 but their are made out of a stronger material but are also a little more expensive.

Hanging chairs: Although hanging chairs are a little more expensive than regular chairs they also are more comftorable because you can put a lot of cushions in them. The hanging chairs that i showed in my room are very expensive so I have also liked another type of hanging chair. The second type of hanging chair hangs from the cieling so it will take a little more time to set up. The type that hangs from the cieling costs $28.99 and the other type costs $327.71.
