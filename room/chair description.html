I chose these chairs specifically because they have are easy to put together and look conftorable. Although some of the reviews claim that they break easily they are also very inexpensive since you can buy a four pack for $141 which averages out to about $35 per chair. I think that the chair looks best in teal, but you can also buy it in aqua, black, fuchsia, grey, harbor grey, orange, red, white, and yellow.
